# autoFaucet
This is an idea that I had on November 28, 2024. I wanted to make a faucet that detects the distance between your hands and the faucet and changes the pressure of the water. This way the water always lands on top of your hands and the pressure is perfect. To change the pressure, you just move your hands to a different distance. This will be achieved with an HC-SRO4 or a laser distance sensor, paired with a pump and an arduino.
